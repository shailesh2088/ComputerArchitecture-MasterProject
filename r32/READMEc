The files in this tarball are for victim cache size 32B.
The file names indicate the associativity for the L1 Caches.
For e.g. gzip1c.out is the output file for a L1 cache with associativity 1, when sim-outorder is run for the gzip benchmark;
while gzip8c.out is the output file for a L1 cache with associativity 8, when sim-outorder is run for the gzip benchmark.

The benchmarks used here are from the SPEC2000 Benchmarks
The integer benchmarks are gzip and gcc
The Floating point benchmarks are equake and lucas
